# Stopped product-ring reproduction

The extension gives the conditional saving `194869/2500000000 = 7.79476e-5`.
It starts from merged PR #36 and is submitted on upstream main at
`56b66d58297deca1d7dd130247d720e960f77a37`.

From the repository root, with Python 3.11+, Make and a C++17 compiler:

```sh
make stopped-product-verify
```

The incremental checks:

- Match the unchanged positive-label h23 bit producer to its verified
  copied-center input, preserving the same matching and histogram.
- Rebuild only the new h24 all-disjoint complex producer with aligned pair
  stars, exact rational center decoding, support and binary-frame checks,
  then reproduce every matching count and histogram entry.
- Reconstruct both child lists and strict rational moments; derive the
  stopped ordinary-bit saving and check that the atom-adapter toll is lower.
- Check the denominator-21 semantic charge, product row stock `p^4000`,
  seven assembly margins and all 47 strict constraints.

Intermediate DAGs and the matcher executable are temporary. To retain them:

```sh
python3 scripts/stopped_product_producer.py --work-dir /tmp/stopped-product-producers
```

For arithmetic alone, use `make stopped-product-certificate`. The inherited
`make verify-producers` also includes this target; the full `make verify`
retains the community and historical checks. Those unchanged suites are
not part of this round's local incremental validation.

The [proof](../notes/stopped-product-note.tex) is supplied as LaTeX source;
no PDF is generated. Its common-basis factorization, atom streaming and
stopping argument, outer ordinary conversion and shared exact rational
grid are written proofs. Finite checks verify the selected scalar data and
arithmetic, not the complete all-size theorem.

[SOURCES.json](../SOURCES.json) and [NOTICE](../NOTICE) preserve contribution
credits and source pins. Existing two-stage, ordinary-leaf and semantic
proof dependencies remain in `references/copied-centers/` and
`references/semantic-bulk/`. Research alternatives, raw binary DAGs and
recursive predecessor copies are excluded from this submission.

## Shared source bindings before submission

The inherited `research/joint-dual/SOURCE.json` also binds the repository's
`Makefile`, `README.md` and `NOTICE`. Adding a verification target or editing
those documents therefore affects the joint-frame check even when its
mathematical construction is unchanged.

After reviewing such source changes, refresh the manifest and regenerate
its dependent certificate and validation receipt:

```sh
python3 scripts/experiments/pin_joint_dual_sources.py
make verify-joint
```

Include `research/joint-dual/SOURCE.json`, `certificates/joint-dual-kappa.json`
and `certificates/joint-dual-validation.json` in the same submission. Check
that their changes are the expected source bindings, then rerun the affected
check against the staged artifacts and require a clean diff. CI verifies
the committed bindings; it does not refresh them automatically.
